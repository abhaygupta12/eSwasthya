# eSwasthya
<h4>eSwasthya</h4>, <p>a decentralised application (DApp) based on blockchain technology and the 
Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Our goal is to build a strong and secure platform for 
decentralised storage and access control of Electronic Health Records (EHR). eSwasthya 
ensures transparency, auditability, and scalability while reducing single points of failure by 
leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS, and public key cryptography. Future 
enhancements will involve the addition of new user categories such as Nominee, Lab 
Technician, and Academic Researchers. Also, it will involve the implemention of a 
Appointment module where the patients can take appointments for their treatments. 
Furthermore, we intend to evaluate the existing and proposed architectures by considering 
cloud-based solutions, examining their compatibility and potential system benefits. The 
eSwasthya project is set to revolutionise health record management, paving the way for a 
more secure, accessible, and efficient healthcare ecosystem.</p>

<h4>Development Environment</h4>

Implementation:

Angular: a front-end web application framework used for building the user interface of the blockchain application

Metamask: a browser extension used for interacting with Ethereum blockchain networks and managing digital assets
Experimental Setup:


Node.js: a JavaScript runtime environment used for building server-side applications

Solidity: a programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain

Ganache: a personal blockchain for Ethereum development and testing

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): a distributed file system for storing and sharing files in a peer-to-peer network
